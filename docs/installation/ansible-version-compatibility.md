# Ansible version compatibility

<!--start requires_ansible-->

This collection has been tested against following Ansible versions

**>=2.15.0**.

For collections that support Ansible 2.9, please ensure you update your `network_os` to use the
fully qualified collection name (for example, `cisco.ios.ios`).
Plugins and modules within a collection may be tested with only specific Ansible versions.
A collection may contain metadata that identifies these versions.
PEP440 is the schema used to describe the versions of Ansible.
